# Jobset Jupyter

Reproducing issue in [https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/jobset/issues/133](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/jobset/issues/133) and providing an example of running an interactive notebook with JobSet.

## Usage

Create a kind cluster. Note that we are using a configuration file that allows for ingress. If you are on a production cluster, it likely comes with ingress capability built in.

```bash
kind create cluster --config ./kind-config.yaml
```

Install JobSet:

```bash
VERSION=v0.3.1
kubectl apply --server-side -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/jobset/releases/download/$VERSION/manifests.yaml
```

Apply the configs here!

```bash
kubectl apply -f jobset.yaml
```

This will create a cluster-level headless service:

```bash
kubectl get svc
```
```console
NAME         TYPE        CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
jupyter      ClusterIP   None         <none>        <none>    4m59s
kubernetes   ClusterIP   10.96.0.1    <none>        443/TCP   14m
```

Now create your ingress.

```bash
kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml
```

You should be able to look at logs:

```

```

And follow the link to open the interface to enter your token "testing" that is defined in the YAML:

For production you'd likely use a secret or secret store for this.
Then, use it! When you are done, you can delete just the jobset to keep your cluster up:

```bash
kubectl delete -f job.yaml
```

Or the entire cluster:

```bash
kind delete cluster
```
